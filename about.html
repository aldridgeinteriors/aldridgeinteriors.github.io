      Great designs begin with close designer-client collaboration. We start with
      an initial meeting to understand your needs, vision, and space. We then
      spend time developing your design, doing whatever we can to help you
      visualize your project. We will stick with you through each step of the
      design process to make sure everything runs smoothly, making appropriate
      changes until the design is complete, and you are satisfied. Our goal is to
      develop lasting relationships and have our clients come back to us for all
      their design needs.
